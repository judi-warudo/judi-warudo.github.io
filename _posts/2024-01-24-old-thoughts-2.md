# Old Thoughts nºII

Everything is saturated with very capable people, what to do then? Dedicate oneself to something lucrative (and saturated) or to something that makes me feel fulfilled (even though it’s equally saturated)? If it’s going to be difficult to find a job anyway, why not trying to do something I enjoy? I don’t know what makes me feel afraid, truth be told, if every road leads to unemployment and unfulfillment. Do I live surrounded by unrealistic reveries?

Everything is saturated, yes, but you can’t live out of thin air or dreams, you can live out of a serious life project. That’s the reason I’m not studying about Japan in the end, doing a Vocational and Educational Training in International Commerce instead. It’s not my favorite option, but it’s the only one between the ones I remotely like that seems viable. I’m also going to improve my level of French towards a B2, and then learn more languages, to distinguish myself from other students. Humanities are restricted to people with complex surnames, and I can’t change that. Now it’s time to focus on this path and attempt to stand out. All this in order not to end up under a bridge. I hope to be motivated and do well in the VET, and to find nice people along the way. That’s my little hope. For the time being, the high school we visited seems like a good place.


God, I’m falling asleep.


I’m also getting my driver’s license.

Yesterday I rewatched “Call Me By Your Name”. Today, I feel like a horrible monster. Both things have nothing to do with each other.


I remember my high school graduation ceremony night. I don’t want to leave, I want to stay and keep talking to N**** and the rest of the people until 8AM. I miss that friendship. I miss all (most of) the friendships I’ve had.

Between yesterday and today I’ve read the first novel of the Captive Prince Trilogy; now I’m reading the second one. I don’t know why I feel inclined to write about these things. It’s like I’m scared of forgetting. I don’t want to go back to live forgetting things. I feel very lonely, the years of loneliness weight on me, along with the feeling of not having been alone for a little while. If I hadn’t ever felt company, I think things would be easier.


I want to turn into a little ball in bed and leave my brain on the bedside table.

I’m tired of the hobby of shit-stirring that some people have. I’m not interested in having your shit taking a walk on my face, thank you.

To what extent do I see enemies everywhere? Are their faces kind or judging? Do they look at me with pity, with mock, or do they feel sorry for my parents? If everything is politics, their glances must be too. I don’t think I will ever in my life feel comfortable when dealing with people. But at the same time, dealing with people is what makes me feel alive.


---


My uncle said that one must be informed about politics to be at the same level as your rival (he said “enemy”, not rival). I don’t know to what extent I prefer to play dumb and pretend not to understand about the topic, and then one day become truly ignorant about it. 


I think about writing, and I feel scared. I don’t want to stop doing it, writing is good for me, not only when I’m doing this, but also when I’m writing novels. I’ll never be someone important, but at least I will be happy expressing myself the only way I know (well, the only way I’m trying to know).


Is it so difficult to ask for a world where mean-spiritedness -not evil - is not the norm? I think that the fuck-you logic is just that, mean-spiritedness.

I think that behind the fear of “what people will say” is not people, but myself. I please others to make me feel good, to not disappoint myself, so I’m the one behind all of it. If I stop feeling the need to please myself, because I already know how much I’m worth, I will stop feeling bad for not meeting the unattainable expectations that I impose myself towards other people.

Until we don’t solve the problem of the mental rendition of most of the population, we won’t be able to advance towards creating a world that is good for everyone.

Why do I want to learn about so many things? I think that reaching the bottom of this matter will clarify for me what to do with my future. For the time being, e-learning programming but, then what? Where do I want to focus my future? I have a list of knowledge fields in front of me, and I find it hard to choose which ones to focus in. I also don’t know how to set goals that motivate me to learn.

I don’t do anything because I know the effort it takes me to be consistent in something grows exponentially. This way, I don’t even get to do one fourth of each thing I set my mind to do. There is no mental barrier, it has to do with the enormous and tiring amount of effort it takes to do something for two consecutive days. Starting something and knowing that the effort to keep it up is added to the effort of already knowing something and of having to build on top of that makes it impossible to me to make anything relevant. I don’t expect anything to be able to help me at this point.

Isn’t it fascinating not knowing where I’ll be in five, two or one year?

Everything is broken and I don’t care, but in a good way. I don’t care where things will go as long as they do go somewhere.

I am also broken. It’s not something bad, it’s not my fault. But I hate not being able to help with anything. I don’t know what to do when I’m feeling better, either. The inertia of continuing to do things doesn’t work with me. Everything is a battle against stasis, and she always wins. I don’t think that anyone can help me, or that anyone will listen to me, or that they see my needs accommodated (whatever needs I need to have accommodated, I still don’t know). I’m scared about starting University for the third time. I like the fact that it’s going to be online, but if I stay as unfunctional as I currently am, I don’t think I’m going to be able to keep it up.
