# Old Thoughts nºI: 2023-02-12/13


I find the innate human kindness and its hypocrisy difficult to reconcile. Are we kind because we are hypocrites, are we hypocrites because we are kind, or are we simply both things? I think about whether one and the other are inherited mechanisms, whether hypocrisy is caused by our current society, or whether hypocrisy is a condition to be a kind person. Is being a kind person getting along with everybody even though some people aren’t the best kind to be around but make you feel good? I refuse to doubt human kindness; the day I do I will go down the cliff to never return.

“Pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will”

I always conceive things in a dichotomic (I had to search that word in the dictionary), irreconcilable way, as if two trains in opposite directions were about to crash with each other. It may come from my education (just like the way I always formulate questions to express my thoughts): good and evil, hypocrisy and honesty, God and nihilism. I don’t know if everything is made of two opposed halves, or if I erroneously see everything that way.

My brother is making popcorn. “I haven’t done anything today”, I think to myself. Well, apart from watching videos and writing this, but I don’t know if it counts. I wish I keep writing in my notebook, writing soothes me. I’m writing a gay romance novel, I hope to finish it one day, but things are getting complex because I’m trying to add fantasy elements to the story. I have another project, which is just an idea, but I want to write about it too.

Tomorrow, I have class about the History of Philosophy. I’m scared about not being serious about it and not being able to start my East Asian Studies BA.

Last time I wrote in a journal was in 2021 and had just received surgery; I wanted to be a diplomat or a professor.  Now I don’t see it as clearly: firstly, it’s going to be financially impossible to me; secondly, if I did what I really wanted to do, it would also be impossible to me. So well, if I get to do something that has to do with East Asia, I’d be happy, I suppose. I don’t consider it a defeat; I’m simply adjusting to reality. The day when every person can see their dreams succeed will come, but that hasn’t happened yet. In any way, a small part of me refuses to believe it. I don’t know if it has to do with idealism, stubbornness, or both. Remember, to me everything is about irreconcilable halves. Or everything works, or everything goes to hell. No grey tones in between.


I consider everything I write very valuable, because these are small pieces of me in specific moments of time. For context, right now, I’m studying a subject of the University Entrance Exam to access the bachelor’s degree in East Asian Studies – Japanese. If I didn’t get in, I’d go into the Chinese specialty of the same bachelor’s, and if even then, I wasn’t able to get in, I’d try to join a high school’s Vocational and Educational Training. I don’t know why I always have so many B plans. Self-distrust, probably.

I listen to the Dakaichi (Dakaretai Otoko 1-i ni Odosarete Imasu) opening, and that makes me really want to learn Japanese to understand it. What I’ll never understand is my interest in toxic romance in fiction. I feel fascinated by the possessiveness of a person towards another, by the way they unwillingly attract each other…

---

It feels embarrassing to admit, but I still consider myself unlovable. As I said some other time, it’s not impossible for me to receive love, but I know that it’s not going to look like the kind of love I need. It’s not as if what I feel that I need is something realistic, because nobody is ever going to feel “blind devotion” towards me. I don’t even consider it something positive or desirable, because it’s quite toxic.

I don’t know what’s going to happen to me, I think that’s the thing I’m most afraid of. My friendships are quite ephemeral, I find it hard to hang out with people other than myself, even though I enjoy it very much, and I am also worried about being older than the people I hang out with. I will have to put it to the test once I start the BA. As I was saying earlier, I am very afraid about what might happen to me in the future, because I still don’t know what I want to do with my life. I see a drawing and I want to dedicate my life (TO DEDICATE MY LIFE) to drawing, the same thing happens to me whenever I read, but I find it impossible to be consistent and to practice so as to improve. At least I’m working on it with regards to writing. This is the same reason I’m going to go to university to learn Japanese, because I know it would be impossible for me to do it on my own. Years go by and I don’t improve but I really do, but I really don’t in an academic nor professional way, but I really do in a personal way. I feel to be growing so much as a person, but I don’t feel satisfied. How easy everything becomes when I write it down. It’s better than to let it rot inside my head. As I was saying, I feel unsatisfied. I’d love to have discipline and be consistent, I know I would have much more knowledge than I do now. I also know that it makes no sense to think about things that I could have started in the past. The best moment to start doing something is now, but I can’t do it. Something stops me as if I was anchored. Ruin, is that you? Be that as it may, I cannot be consistent nor disciplined. I live waiting for something to change me but, shouldn’t I have to provoke that something?


If I listed everything I want to learn, I wouldn’t ever finish. I should prioritize some things, and I’m working on it, but even with that I can’t seem to function. History, economics, politics, social skills, business, East Asian culture, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, French, Esperanto?, philosophy, physics, mathematics, literature, … the list is endless, but my life is limited.
